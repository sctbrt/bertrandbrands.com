# CLAUDE.md - Bertrand Brands

## Version 5.2.0 (Current)

This document is the **Bertrand Brands-specific** guide. For full ecosystem context, see `/Users/scottbertrand/Sites/scottbertrand.com/CLAUDE.md`.

---

## 0. Consolidated Addendum (Authoritative)

**Status:** Positioning, Language, and Implementation Lock
**Effective:** February 1, 2026

This section establishes hard constraints, style governance, and implementation compass for all Claude interactions with this project.

---

### 0.1 High-Level Context

Bertrand Brands is a **Brand & Web Systems Studio**.

Its purpose is to design and build clear, structured, conversion-focused brand and web systems for small to mid-sized businesses—primarily in Northern Ontario.

**Bertrand Brands is not:**
- a generalist design agency
- a marketing or growth agency
- a performance or ads shop
- a technology-forward or "AI-first" studio (externally)

**The studio's value is rooted in:**
- clarity
- structure
- restraint
- speed without chaos

All outputs must reinforce this identity.

---

### 0.2 Absolute Language Rules (Non-Negotiable)

#### Forbidden External Language

Claude must **never** surface the following in public-facing materials, UI text, service descriptions, or client documentation:
- AI
- Artificial intelligence
- Machine learning
- Agents
- "AI-powered"
- "AI-driven"
- "Smart" (when implying intelligence)
- Automation when referring to intelligence or decision-making

These concepts may exist internally only and must remain invisible to clients.

#### Approved External Vocabulary

When describing how work is done, Claude should use:
- Systems
- Tooling
- Modern workflows
- Infrastructure
- Internal frameworks
- Optimized processes
- Streamlined execution

**Example (approved):**
> "We use modern tooling and internal frameworks to move quickly without compromising quality."

Claude should default to this vocabulary unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

---

### 0.3 The Bertrand Method™ (Required Framing)

All work—copy, structure, documentation, and explanation—must align to the following method:

1. **Clarify** — Define the message, audience, and objective.
2. **Structure** — Design the system behind the brand and site.
3. **Build** — Execute with precision and restraint.
4. **Stabilize** — Test, refine, and harden the system.
5. **Enable** — Prepare the client for confident ownership.

Claude should reuse this framing wherever logical to reinforce consistency.

---

### 0.4 Tone & Brand Guardrails

All outputs must feel:
- Calm
- Precise
- Thoughtful
- Modern
- Architected

**Avoid:**
- hype
- sales language
- trend-driven phrasing
- over-explaining technology
- jargon without necessity

If a sentence feels "impressive" rather than clear, it should be simplified.

**The desired client reaction is:**
> "This feels considered and easy."

---

### 0.5 Implementation Behavior Rules

When generating or modifying:
- website copy
- UI text
- service descriptions
- technical documentation
- internal architecture notes

Claude must:
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Default to minimalism
- Reduce words where possible without losing meaning
- Treat tooling as invisible infrastructure
- Never expose internal execution mechanics to end users
- Avoid explaining how something is fast — only that it is reliable and considered

---

### 0.6 Launch Context (Operational Constraint)

- **Public launch date:** February 4, 2026
- **Initial emphasis:** Focus Studio offerings
- **Market:** Sudbury + Northern Ontario
- **Primary KPI:** qualified leads, not traffic

All changes should support:
- low friction
- fast comprehension
- immediate confidence

---

### 0.7 Internal Truth vs External Narrative (Critical)

**Internal truth:**
Bertrand Brands operates with advanced tooling, parallel workflows, and agent-assisted execution.

**External narrative:**
Bertrand Brands is human-led, system-driven, calm, and deliberate.

This asymmetry is intentional and must be preserved across all outputs.

---

### 0.8 Final Instruction

When in doubt:
- remove a sentence
- simplify the explanation
- choose restraint over completeness
- choose structure over flourish

**Bertrand Brands should always feel older, calmer, and more certain than the market around it.**

---

## 1. Operating Context

### 1.1 Role & Boundaries

**Bertrand Brands** is a Sudbury-based brand, web, and systems studio led by Scott Bertrand.

**Scott handles:**
- Brand strategy & judgment
- Design direction & taste
- Client communication

**Claude handles:**
- Coding, refactors, audits
- Structured documentation
- System integrity and consistency

### 1.2 Core Operating Philosophy

**Structure Reduces Anxiety**

All systems must prioritize:
- Clarity
- Predictability
- Low cognitive overhead

Avoid cleverness. Favor legibility and durability.

**BRIGHTS Values Are Non-Negotiable**

All decisions must align with BRIGHTS:
- **B**elonging
- **R**espect
- **I**ntegrity
- **G**rowth
- **H**ealth (mental + physical safety)
- **T**rust (care, reliability)
- **S**afety

If a technical or UX decision introduces confusion, pressure, or ambiguity, it violates BRIGHTS.

### 1.3 Service Architecture (LOCKED — Feb 2026)

Bertrand Brands operates under **THREE strictly hierarchical service tiers**:

**Mental Model:** Conversation → Execution → Transformation

---

**Tier 1 — B Exploratory Sessions** (Entry/Qualification)
- Paid clarity conversations
- Trust-building and qualification
- 45 minutes, paid upfront
- NO deliverables (conversation only)
- Subtle visual placement (not dominant)

| Offering | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Brand Clarity Call | 45 min | Conversation-only brand clarity |
| Website Clarity Call | 45 min | Conversation-only website clarity |

---

**Tier 2 — B Focus Studio** (Primary Revenue Engine)
- Fixed-scope execution
- Fixed price, clear timelines
- Paid before deliverable handoff

| Offering | Price | Timeline |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Quick Website Refresh | $750 CAD | 1 business day |
| One-Page Redesign | $1,250 CAD | 2–3 business days |
| Brandmarking Package | $950 CAD | 5–7 business days |

---

**Tier 3 — B Core Services** (Transformational)
- Multi-week, relationship-based work
- 50% deposit to begin, 50% on delivery
- Includes ALL of the following (exactly 5):

| Offering | Starting Price |
|----------|----------------|
| Comprehensive Website Audit | Private |
| Strategic Brand Audit | Private |
| Brand Reset | $3,000+ CAD |
| Website Foundation | $3,500+ CAD |
| Full Brand + Website Reset | $6,500+ CAD |

---

**Key Principles:**
- No open-ended scope
- No vague deliverables
- No ad-hoc calls outside defined services
- No hourly/time-based pricing language
- AI efficiency increases margin, not discount justification
- Prices ≤$1,500 are shown publicly; prices ≥$3,000 use private/starting pricing

**Never invent new services, pricing, or scopes.**

### 1.4 Visual Hierarchy (LOCKED)

**Homepage Section Order (Top to Bottom):**
1. **B Focus Studio** — Primary, largest, most prominent
2. **B Core Services** — Includes both Audits & Reviews and Builds & Resets
3. **B Exploratory Sessions** — Subtle, contextual ("Not sure where to start?")

**Key Visual Rules:**
- Focus Studio appears FIRST (commercial priority, not tier priority)
- Exploratory Sessions is Tier 1 conceptually but visually subtle (side door, not front door)
- Focus Studio uses solid borders; Exploratory uses dashed borders
- Both sub-brands use shared B logomark with differentiated wordmarks

**Navigation Order:**
1. Focus Studio (first in dropdown)
2. Core Services (second in dropdown)

### 1.5 AI Positioning (Critical)

**AI is never positioned as the product.**

Externally:
- Language centers on systems, clarity, structure
- AI is implied, not advertised

Internally:
- Claude handles execution
- ChatGPT assists with strategy, synthesis, and language
- Human judgment remains the authority

If a solution makes AI visible to clients, flag it as a risk.

### 1.6 Decision Rules

When unsure, default to:
1. Simpler
2. Clearer
3. More documented
4. Less emotionally demanding for the user

If something:
- Increases cognitive load
- Creates edge-case anxiety
- Requires constant explanation

→ It should be redesigned.

### 1.7 Success Criteria

A successful implementation:
- Feels calm
- Requires minimal explanation
- Is easy to maintain
- Can be reused across brands
- Supports future delegation

**Bertrand Brands is not scaling chaos—it is scaling clarity.**

## 5. V5.0 Design Philosophy

### 5.1 Core Aesthetic Principles

V5.0.0 builds on the refined, minimal, architectural approach with **performance-first optimizations**:

- **Restraint over spectacle** — Effects should be barely perceptible
- **Content-first** — Design serves content, never competes with it
- **Material realism** — Glass and lighting should feel physical, not digital
- **Time-aware theming** — Sites respond to time of day (Canada/Eastern)

### 5.2 Bertrand Brands Expression

Bertrand Brands is **more expressive** than scottbertrand.com:

- RGB ethereal effects permitted (subtly)
- Animated gradients on key CTAs
- Mobile hamburger menu with transitions
- RGB border animations on secondary CTAs
- Ethereal text glow on hover states
- Three RGB spotlights (mobile hero only)

---

- Keep diffs minimal
- Preserve existing formatting
- No build step required (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

### Motion

- Restrained but expressive (more than scottbertrand.com)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Accessibility

- Maintain WCAG contrast ratios
- Provide fallbacks for `backdrop-filter`
- Do not break keyboard navigation

---

## 13. Related Systems (system-build)

The **Internal System** at `/Users/scottbertrand/Sites/scottbertrand.com/system-build/` powers:

- **dashboard.bertrandbrands.com** — Admin CRM dashboard
- **clients.bertrandbrands.com** — Client portal ("Delivery Room")

See main CLAUDE.md sections 14–16 for locked specs:

- **Section 14**: Client Portal v1 ("Delivery Room")
- **Section 15**: Admin / CRM Dashboard v1

**Launch target**: Feb 3, 2026

---

## 14. CRM Dashboard Design (V1.1)

The admin dashboard at `dashboard.bertrandbrands.com` follows these design patterns:

### 14.1 Header Breadcrumb

Dynamic breadcrumb showing current section:
```
BERTRAND BRANDS | Customer Relationship Management | {Section}
```
- Brand name is clickable, returns to Overview
- Section updates dynamically based on current route

### 14.2 Navigation Badge Counts

Sidebar nav items show real-time counts for actionable items:
- **Leads**: Count of NEW status leads
- **Invoices**: Count of unpaid invoices (SENT, VIEWED, OVERDUE)

Badges use amber accent color: `bg-amber-500/20 text-amber-400`

### 14.3 Stat Cards

Overview stat cards include:
- **Icons** in top-right corner (subtle, turns amber on hover)
- **Hover animation**: `scale-[1.02]` with border color change
- **Clickable**: Navigate to respective section

### 14.4 Status Badge Color System

Consistent status colors across all pages using semi-transparent backgrounds with borders:

**Lead Statuses:**
- NEW: `bg-amber-500/20 text-amber-400 border-amber-500/30`
- CONTACTED: `bg-sky-500/20 text-sky-400 border-sky-500/30`
- QUALIFIED: `bg-emerald-500/20 text-emerald-400 border-emerald-500/30`
- CONVERTED: `bg-violet-500/20 text-violet-400 border-violet-500/30`
- DISQUALIFIED: `bg-rose-500/20 text-rose-400 border-rose-500/30`
- ARCHIVED: `bg-zinc-500/20 text-zinc-400 border-zinc-500/30`

**Project Statuses:**
- DRAFT: `bg-zinc-500/20 text-zinc-400 border-zinc-500/30`
- PENDING_APPROVAL: `bg-amber-500/20 text-amber-400 border-amber-500/30`
- IN_PROGRESS: `bg-emerald-500/20 text-emerald-400 border-emerald-500/30`
- ON_HOLD: `bg-orange-500/20 text-orange-400 border-orange-500/30`
- COMPLETED: `bg-sky-500/20 text-sky-400 border-sky-500/30`
- CANCELLED: `bg-rose-500/20 text-rose-400 border-rose-500/30`

---

## 18. Pricing & Marketing Strategy

### 18.1 Pricing Philosophy

- Pricing is **outcome- and deliverable-based**, never time-based
- AI efficiency increases margin and focus, not justification to discount
- Prices are upper-mid for Sudbury market, acceptable with clear scope and confident presentation
- **Do not discount publicly**

### 18.2 Local Incentive Strategy (Approved)

For Sudbury-first campaigns, local incentives may be offered via:
- Google Ads landing pages only
- CTA pages only (not global site)

**Framing (approved language):**
- "Local launch"
- "Community-first access"
- "Sudbury partnership"

**Never use:**
- "Discount" language
- Public pricing reductions
- Site-wide promotions

**Implementation:**
- Optional promo code field in intake forms
- Code visibility restricted to ad-specific landing pages only

### 18.3 Campaign Focus

- Single campaign only (no split testing yet)
- Campaign focus: Focus Studio offerings
- Main CTA for ads: Direction Session ($145) or specific Focus Studio service page

---
