## BRIGHTS Framework

### Belonging
Clients and collaborators should feel oriented, not intimidated.
Systems should invite understanding, not test intelligence.

### Respect
Respect time, attention, and energy.
No unnecessary meetings. No performative work.

### Integrity
Do what was promised.
Say no when scope is unclear.
No hidden tradeoffs.

### Growth
Improve systems deliberately.
Avoid novelty for novelty's sake.

### Health
Mental and physical safety are non-negotiable.
No urgency theater. No artificial pressure.

### Trust
Reliability over charm.
Consistency over persuasion.

### Safety
Predictable processes.
Clear expectations.
No surprise obligations.

## Application

BRIGHTS informs:
- How work is scoped
- How clients are guided
- How boundaries are enforced

BRIGHTS is **felt before it is named**.
It should only be surfaced publicly once it is earned.
